Steganography is used to hide information. WAVE-Steganography can be used
to hide data (a "secret") inside a WAV file (a "cover"). This
technique is based on algorithms described
[here](http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/147552/14/14_chapter%205.pdf)
(5.1,5.2).


## Algorithms for Embedding
#### Hide text in audio ([5.1](http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/147552/14/14_chapter%205.pdf))
```
1. Read the text and cover audio file to get the audio samples and the
frequency.
2. Encrypt text file using [specify later].
3. Convert the encrypted text file to binary.
4. Use discrete wavelet transformation function (Haar IWT) to tranform
the cover, returning detailed coefficients CD and approximation
coefficients CA.
5. Embed the encrypted text.
    5a. Hide the message size (the first CD coefficient is replaced by
    the size).
    5b. Hide the actual message.
6. Reconstruction of stego audio signal by applying inverse DWT to
CA and modified CD.
```


#### Hide image in audio ([5.2](http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/147552/14/14_chapter%205.pdf))

```
1. Read the image and cover audio file to get the audio samples and the
frequency.
2. Encrypt image using modified Arnold transformation.
3. Convert the encrypted image to binary.
4. Use discrete wavelet transformation function (Haar IWT) to tranform
the cover, returning detailed coefficients CD and approximation
coefficients CA.
5. Convert CD to binary.
6. For each coefficient of CD:
    6a) if 2^p <= CD and CD < 2^(p+1) for some integer p
    6b) NBR <- p - OBH (original bits to be held)
7. Remaining replaceable bits of each CD are used to store the encrypted
image. The image bits starting from MSB, are stored in LSBâ€™s of each CD.
8. Reconstruction of stego audio signal by applying inverse DWT to
CA and modified CD.
